## 👩‍💻 Free for Makers 👨‍💻

Stream is free for most side and hobby projects. To qualify, your project/company needs to have < 5 team members and < $10k in monthly revenue. Makers get $100 in monthly credit for feeds for free.

## 💡 Supported Features 💡

Here are some of the features we support:

- **For-You feed**: Most modern apps combine a “For You” feed with a regular “Following” feed. With activity selectors you can:
  - surface popular activities
  - show activities near the user
  - match activities to a user’s interests
  - mix-and-match these selectors to build an engaging personalized feed.
- **Comments**: Voting, threading, images, URL previews, @mentions & notifications. Basically all the features of Reddit style commenting systems.
- **Advanced feed features**: Activity expiration • visibility controls • feed visibility levels • feed members • bookmarking • follow-approval flow • stories support.
- **Activity filtering**: Filter activity feeds with almost no hit to performance
- **Search & queries**: Activity search, **query activities**, and **query feeds** endpoints.
- **Modern essentials**: Permissions • OpenAPI spec • GDPR endpoints • realtime WebSocket events • push notifications • “own capabilities” API.

## React demo app

Deployed version: https://feeds-react-tutorial-getstreamio.vercel.app/

Prerequisites:

- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Build React SDK: `yarn build:client` and `yarn build:react-sdk`
- Create a `.env` file in `sample-apps/react-demo`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_SECRET=your_API_secret
```

After the above steps run the following command in `sample-apps/react-demo`:

```
yarn dev
```

You can provide `user_id=<user id>` query param when opening the app, or provide nothing, and let the application generate a user for you.

## Test Data Generator

The `test-data-generator` directory contains scripts to populate your Stream Feeds app with sample data for testing and development purposes.

### Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in `test-data-generator/` with your credentials:

```
STREAM_API_KEY=<Stream API key>
API_SECRET=<Stream API secret>
API_URL=<Optional, Stream API URL>
```

2. Install dependencies: `yarn` (from the repository root)

### Typical use-case

Run these scripts in the following order from `test-data-generator` folder:

```bash
yarn create-users
yarn create-follows
# Adjust what features you need
yarn create-posts --features link,attachment,mention,poll,reaction,comment,bookmark,repost
# Optional, only useful if you have story feeds
yarn create-stories
# Optional, for hashtag feeds (e.g. hashtag suggestions in composer)
yarn create-hashtag-group
# Optional, if you want premium posts too
yarn create-premium-membership

### Create Posts Feature Flags

The `create-posts` script supports a `--features` flag to control which features are included in the generated posts:

```bash
yarn create-posts --features <feature1,feature2,...>
```

**Available features:**

| Feature      | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `link`       | Adds random URLs to posts                |
| `attachment` | Uploads and attaches 1-3 images to posts |
| `mention`    | Adds @mentions to other users            |
| `poll`       | Creates and attaches polls to posts      |
| `reaction`   | Adds 1-5 reactions from random users     |
| `comment`    | Adds 1-5 comments from random users      |
| `bookmark`   | Bookmarks posts by random users          |
| `repost`     | Creates reposts of existing activities   |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create basic posts without any features
yarn create-posts

# Create posts with polls and reactions
yarn create-posts --features poll,reaction

# Create posts with all content features
yarn create-posts --features link,attachment,mention,poll,reaction,comment,bookmark,repost
```

> Note: Each feature has a probability of being included (not every post will have every enabled feature). Link and attachment are mutually exclusive per post.

### Download Images flags

The `download-images` script downloads 100 sample images (from picsum.photos) into `test-data-generator/images/`. By default it skips images that already exist.

| Flag                           | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--replace=N` or `--replace N` | Force re-download of specific image(s). `N` can be a single index (1–100) or comma-separated indices (e.g. `--replace=1,5,10`). |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Re-download only image 42
yarn download-images --replace=42

# Re-download images 1, 5 and 10
yarn download-images --replace 1,5,10
```
