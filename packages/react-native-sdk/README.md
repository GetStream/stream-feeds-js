  - show activities near the user
  - match activities to a user’s interests
  - mix-and-match these selectors to build an engaging personalized feed.
- **Comments**: Voting, threading, images, URL previews, @mentions & notifications. Basically all the features of Reddit style commenting systems.
- **Advanced feed features**: Activity expiration • visibility controls • feed visibility levels • feed members • bookmarking • follow-approval flow • stories support.
- **Activity filtering**: Filter activity feeds with almost no hit to performance
- **Search & queries**: Activity search, **query activities**, and **query feeds** endpoints.
